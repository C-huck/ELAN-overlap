# ELAN-overlap
Extract temporal information about annotations on different tiers in ELAN. 
So far:
  1. reports overlaps between two tiers
  2. reports type of overlap (right edge, left edge, contains and is-contained
  3. reports duration of overlaps
To do:
  1. flexibly apply algorithm to user-specified number of tiers
  2. add key-word search
